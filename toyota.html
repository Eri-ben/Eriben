      <p style="width: 95%; margin: 16px auto;">As part of my Summer Internship at Toyota Material Handling, I conducted a Design Review of a website service that was planned for re-design.</p>

        <div class="projectsubheader">The background</div>
      <p>When I joined Toyota Material Handling as a Summer Intern, the idea was that I would partake in an intern project group to develop a prototype for an in-house tool to facilitate the work process
        for the engineers of the company. After some researching into the topic, however, our team concluded that it would simply be more beneficial for the company to buy an existing solution, as the development
        of a completely new one (technically speaking) would cost much more in terms of prototyping and testing physical parts. For this reason, my background as a UX-Designer was less needed in this project, and
        I moved on to become more of a Business Analyst.
      </p>
      <p>However, as I now had more time free, I contacted the ordinary UX Team at Toyota Material Handling and was given the task to perform an Expert/Design Review of Toyota Material Handling's "I_Site" which
        had been on the UX Team's radar for redesign for a while.

        <div class="projectsubheader">The context</div>
        <p>When I joined Toyota Material Handling as a Summer Intern, UX as a concept was still fairly new for most of the company and it still had some work to do in order to be fully embraced by the teams.
          Prior to hiring UX Designers, the design of the systems mostly landed on the hands of the programmers, which lended the developed products to have a high degree of feeling of ownership by those who
          had created the systems.
  
        <p>One of these systems was called I_Site, which while pretty on the surface, had a number of usability issues that hindered new clients from using the product. As the rest of the UX team were busy
          with various other projects but still observed a need to redesign the system as well as persuade others that it did indeed deserve one, UX Lead put me to perform a thorough Design Review of I_Site.

        <div class="projectsubheader">The Design Review</div>
        <p>To help me with the design review, I utilized <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen Norman Group's 10 Usability Heuristics</a> and put them in an Excel sheet
        for each unique page of the website. Then, I performed a heuristic evaluation on each page to write down my findings in the same sheet. This was used as a general frame in structuring my findings which
        helped a lot for the most general usability issues. </p>

        </div>
        <p>After all pages had been analyzed, I summarized my findings into my Design Review document which ended up consisting of 10 tailor made themes for I_Site. Focus was put to make the document simple
          and readable even for non UX-practitioners.</p>
