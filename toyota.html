      <p style="width: 95%; margin: 16px auto;">As part of my Summer Internship at Toyota Material Handling, I conducted a Design Review of a website service that was planned for re-design.</p>

       
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 32px;">
        <img src="images/ToyotaLogo.svg" style="width: 70%; background: white; padding: 32px; margin: 32px;">
      </div>

      <div class="projectsubheader">The context</div>
      <p>* Joined with a team of other Summer Interns to develop something new
        * We made some early researched and proposed to our manager that it would simply be more efficient to buy an existing solution for this very case (As it would be part physical, buying
        physical parts to test on would be very expensive)
        * This meant that my role was less needed, so I moved to become more of a Business Analyst on 50%
        * With some free time here, I looked up the ordinary UX Team in the company
        * They gave me the task as the company was still quite new to the concept of UX

        As part of my Summer Internship I was.... This was an interesting..... as the company was still very new to the concept of UX.
