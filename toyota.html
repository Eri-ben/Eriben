          <div class="projectsubheader">Design Review of I_Site</div>
      </div>
      

      <p style="width: 95%; margin: 16px auto;">As part of my Summer Internship at Toyota Material Handling, I conducted a Design Review of a website service that was planned for re-design.</p>

       
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 32px;">
        <img src="images/ToyotaLogo.svg" style="width: 70%; background: white; padding: 32px; margin: 32px;">
      </div>

      <div class="projectsubheader">The background</div>
      <p>When I joined Toyota Material Handling as a Summer Intern, the idea was that I would partake in an intern project group to develop a prototype for an in-house tool to facilitate the work process
        for the engineers of the company. After some researching into the topic, however, our team concluded that it would simply be more beneficial for the company to buy an existing solution, as the development
        of a completely new one (technically speaking) would cost much more in terms of prototyping and testing physical parts. For this reason, my background as a UX-Designer was less needed in this project, and
        I moved on to become more of a Business Analyst.
      </p>
      <p>However, as I now had more time free, I contacted the ordinary UX Team at Toyota Material Handling and was given the task to perform an expert/design review of Toyota Material Handling's "I_Site" which
        had been on the UX Team's radar for redesign for a while.
      </p>


      <div class="projectsubheader">The context</div>
      <p>When I joined Toyota Material Handling as a Summer Intern, UX as a concept was still fairly new for most of the company and it still had some work to do in order to be fully embraced by the teams.
        Prior to hiring UX Designers, the design of the systems mostly landed on the hands of the programmers, which lended the developed products to have a high degree of feeling of ownership by those who
        had created the systems.

      <P>One of these systems was called I_Site, which while pretty on the surface, had a number of usability issues that hindered new clients from using the product. As the rest of the UX team were busy
        with various other projects
      </P>

      <div class="projectsubheader">I_Site</div>
        <p>Kort text h√§r +  bild</p>
        * Joined with a team of other Summer Interns to develop something new
        * We made some early researched and proposed to our manager that it would simply be more efficient to buy an existing solution for this very case (As it would be part physical, buying
        physical parts to test on would be very expensive)
        * This meant that my role was less needed, so I moved to become more of a Business Analyst on 50%
        * With some free time here, I looked up the ordinary UX Team in the company
        * They gave me the task as the company was still quite new to the concept of UX

        As part of my Summer Internship I was.... This was an interesting..... as the company was still very new to the concept of UX.

        **
        There was some degree of ownership of I_Site by the engineers who had programmed it,
