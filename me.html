            For as long as I can remember, I've had a lasting 
            fascination about human use of technology and
            human behaviour in society. Even in my early
            years, I was drawn to naturally appearing
            trails in parks and forests. It was not their
            physical apperance that interested me, rather I
            realised how deep they really were, since for
            every path that had been procedurally created
            by us humans also hinted on a plethora of
            stories.<br><br> In a way, walkpaths are fossil not of
            what people are, but of what people do. I often pondered,
            and actually still ponder about, what people did to
            form these paths - and why they were eventually 
            formed to begin with.</p>

          <h3>My interests and drives</h3>
          <p>
            My special interest and focus lays in understanding and designing for those environments that are really complex, and where flexible and sustainable communication needs to be
            witheld between multiple users at the same time. We live in an entangled and busy world, but our wiring is not done very well even these days. Products, services
            and so on don't talk with each other very well and this is especially true for collaborative matter. In the future, technology has to be sure to work in a society, and not only
            for a pack of individuals. I'm currently sketching on starting my own personal blog to discuss these topics as I find them very important, and I hope to open it one day very soon!
            <br><br>
            My aim as a UX practicioneer is to deliver meaningful design that either help users and stakeholders in their daily life, or at least gives them a fantastic experience they will
            remember. But sometimes, I'd just want people to not notice my design at all! That would just mean that the design (hopefully) does what it should do, and does not cause any
            trouble for the user. That would, in fact, be a fantastic result.
