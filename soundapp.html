        <p>
            The human brain is very good at detecting sudden changes in sound levels, but it is also very good at filtering unwanted continuous sources of sound, also known as noise.
            This filtering process is in many ways great in order to make us keep our focus on our tasks even if there are disturbing elements around us. <br><br>
            On the other hand, prolonged and high levels of noise has shown to have negative effects of an individual's well being. This project aims to propose a solution of a passive
            sound pollution tracker for a smart watch to help people get a better understanding of this rather untangible (matter). The chosen medium for this is a smartwatch.<br><br>

            The final design was made in Adobe XD.
        </p>

        <div class="projectsubheader">Context</div>
        <p>
          This project was undertaken as a part of the course "Mobile Computing - Design and Implementation" held at Chalmers University of Technology. Me and 
            <a href="http://www.sjoerdhendriks.com/">Sjoerd Hendriks</a> were the main designers of the team of 6 members, where the remaining 4 worked with an Implementation prototype
            via coding for Android in Java: Tommy Ohlsson, <a href="https://jwpihlgren.github.io/index.html">Joachim Pihlgren</a>, Robin Edquist, and Daniel Illipe.<br><br>

            The course gave us the theme "Health and/or Exercise" to work with.
        </p>
        
        <div class="projectsubheader">Problem statement</div>
        <p>
          How can we make people more aware or informed of their exposed levels of noise in their daily lives?<br><br>
        </p>
                
        <div class="projectsubheader" style="margin-top: 16px;">Process</div>
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
          <img src= "images/MC_process.png" class="renterximg" style="width: 75%; text-align: center; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom:8px; height: unset;">
          <p>Our project was divided into a "Development Team" and a "Design Team". <!--This gave me interesting experience in how it is to work in a more "complete" setting where communication
            is extra important in order to keep different teams in sync. --><br><br> As we knew it would be a lot of new stuff to take in, especially for the development team, we decided to structure our
            syncing so that the design team was always one step ahead in the "cycle" compared to the development team. <!--<br><br> The process disposition of the design team was the following:</p>

        <h3>Brainwriting & Ideation</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            At the beginning of our project we had not defined our focus yet, so before we knew what we wanted to do, we performed a brainwriting session to come up with ideas. The only constraints we had 
            were from our given project description was that it had to be health or exercise related, and on an android platform. <br><br>
          </p>
          <div id="brainwritingpar">
            After some brainwriting, we reached the topic of air pollution which is a big issue in many cities. Eventually, we switched our focus from air to sound pollution as it is a growing issue in many urban
            environments, which we also feel has not been touched upon as much as air pollution (Despite being very important for well-being!).<br><br>
           
            The first idea we had was actually quite different from where we eventually landed. The idea was to have a mobile phone application where users can upload data points to a map of manually
            recordings. This idea was later scrapped.

        <!--
        <h3>Literature</h3>
        <p>
          While we were still setting up our project, we read up on some of the area. 
        </p>-->

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>To get a better understanding of how people perceive noise we interviewed 5 university students in other classes. The interviews covered their relation to sound and noise, 
          and how they acted before, during, and after exercising. We also touched upon reasons for e.g. not exercising (We still had an idea to make our solution exercise related),
          what made them calm or stressed in regards to noise, and how they perceived being exposed to noise in their daily routine. <br><br>
        </p>

        <!--HA MED SURVEY?-->

        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        <div class="methoddescription">
          <p>The findings from our interviews (and survey) were compiled into an affinity diagram consisting of 5 overlying themes:
            <ul>
              <li>Effects of noise</li>
              <li>Dealing with noise</li>
              <li>Sources of noise</li>
              <li>Users degree of autonomy (Over space & time)</li>
              <li>Characteristics of noise</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/MC_AffinityDiagram.jpg" id="soundappAD">
        <p>The Affinity diagram helped us gain an understanding of the dimensions we were working with, which further helped us in our next ideation phase. </p>
        <p>With our newfound insights, we realised that our initial idea was not particularly useful, nor particularly innovative. Simply put, people would have to repeatedly pick up their phone
          to manually check their noise levels <i>in situ</i> (Which has already been done by many parts), and noise levels on certain streets can be very time specific for certain hours during the day which can render
          one data point at 5AM doubtable for a 2PM occasion.
        </p>

        <h3>Ideation 2 - The turning point</h3>
        <div class="methoddescription" style="vertical-align: top;">
          <p>
            For this reason, we re-iterated on our idea. The affinity diagram was especially helpful in this step as it finally gave us a framework we could relate to. Themes such as lack of
            autonomy (such as working at a place with potential to high noise levels) really helped us see the problem in new light, but also new solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
          We realised we wanted something more prolonged that could tailor the data gathered to a specific individual. That's when we concluded we wanted to collect (latent) noise data for the whole day
          for the user to observe at a later occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
          For a short while, the idea was still on a mobile phone. We made a quick mock-up to see how we felt about it and that's when it hit us: this thing should actually not be on a mobile phone! It should be
          on a smartwatch!
        </p>
        
          <!--
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          * We landed on this solution XYZ
          * But then we had one technical limitation raised by the development team
            - A mobile phone are often in pockets, bags etc.
            - So we had to find a technical solution to that or reconsider our idea
          * That's when we finally landed on our idea to have a smartwatch app.
          * This was a radical move, especially for the development team who had been reading up on android development for mobile phones.-->

        </div>

        <p>
          This was a radical step in a new direction. The course content had primarily touched upon the design and implementation for mobile devices (specifically, android phones) - and it did require
          some persuading the implementation team who had been working on setting up an environment for the mobile phone. Nonetheless, we felt that this was the right decision that made most sense, as a
          watch would be much less likely to be hidden inside a pocket or bag than a mobile phone - opening up for more opportunities to collect sounds for noise. <br><br>

          There was also a technical factor that made this decision feel right for us, even if it meant that both we designers has to read up on new
          <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/wear">design guidelines</a> and programming framework.
          <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 32px;">

            <a style="font-size: 10px;">Start page of the Wear OS Design Guidelines</a> 
          </div>
        </p>

        <h1>The final idea</h1>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
          <li style="margin: 16px;">An app for a Wear OS Smartwatch that lets users modelessly monitor their daily dose of noise as an overlay of their watches' face.</li>
          <li style="margin: 16px;">An app that can help users reduce their subjection to noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Designing for a smartwatch was new for us all in the group as neither of us had one. At the same time, there are not too many people using smartwatches, especially with Wear OS.
          As Wear OS has its own design language, this meant that it would be hard for us to find users who were familiar with its patterns. <br><br>

          We also had to read up on the <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/wear">Wear OS Design Guidelines</a>. However, while it does present some great patterns to use, it is a far less
          developed library compared to the general android design guidelines.
        </p>

        <h3>Sketching & Further ideation</h3>
        <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 380px;">
          <p style="margin-top: 0;">In order to explore the design space we started sketching on solutions. Here, we had a discussion of exactly what features we wanted to include. <br><br>
          As we continued to sketch and read up on the guidelines, we converged we landed on a condensed app with few but focused design areas. Face design, real time dB check, mic muting, recording interval,
          and notification setting.
          
        </div>
        <img src="images/MC_Sketches.jpg" class="renterximg soundappimages">

        <h3>Informal user testing & Presentation</h3>
        <p>We brought our sketches to our teachers, other group members and other design students for an informal discussion regarding our idea.
          In general, people were very sold on the idea, though the novel nature of the medium meant that the feedback gained revolved more around general concepts than specific
          interface elements. On the other hand, one person expressed how he did not see a point of getting a smartwatch but would start to consider getting one if there were apps like ours.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Design areas</h3>
        <p>
        Based on our sketching, further ideation and feedback, we created a simplified site map which divided the app into three areas.
          <ul>
            <li>The Face Design: Had to be modeless and "under" the regular clock interface</li> Here, the design guidelines were not very thorough. <br><br>
            <li>The real-time dB check: Users should be able to check the current decibel levels on their smartwatch</li> <br>
            <li>Notifications, Settings and Muting: Users should be able to decide if they should be notified upon being exposed to certain levels, and mute the system at will.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

       
        <h3>Hi-fi Prototyping</h3>
        <p>The final prototype was made using Adobe XD. Sjoerd Hendriks mainly worked with the app's face design and real-time dB tracking, and I mainly worked with navigation menus.</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">

          </video>
        </div>

        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
        <!--
        <p>Lite designrationale kanske? 3-5 stycken borde rÃ¤cka... 
          Enligt guidelines:<br><br>
          * Glancable: Kan bara titta pÃ¥ face, "mycket information" pÃ¥ liten yta.<br>
          * Timely: Notifications pÃ¥ rÃ¤tt stÃ¤lle<br>
          * Easy to tap: Navigation tÃ¤cker hela ytan, inte massa krussiduller<br><br>

          Mycket potential har lÃ¤mnats ut fÃ¶r att det helt enkelt blir fÃ¶r komplicerat (mobilens mobil, skulle kunna kompletteras med en mer inÃ¥tgÃ¥ende mobillapplikation som kopplas)-

        </p>-->
        

        <p>The findings from our interview and affinity diagram revealed how little people actually think about noise levels in real-time, and that it often comes as a reflection as a later occasion
          when things are calmer (e.g. when coming home from work or a party). <br><br>We wanted to let people passively monitor their exposure without having to constantly think about it, while still offering
          room for modeless feedback.

          <ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px">The long-term visualisation is designed to be glancable. That is, a quick observation should be enough to get something out of it.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px">By allowing notifications and warnings about sound levels be customisable, timely notifications "right in time" are more expected to occur.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px">By hollowing the WearOS Design guidelines, navigation of the app covers the whole screen to allow for imprecise clicking. In-app interface is also scaled down.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">About that physical prototype</h3>
        <div id="aboutthatphysical">
          <p style="margin-top: 0;">So at this stage, you may be thinking "Wait, so what about the implementation of this design as a physical protoype?

            Well actually, throughout this project, we had consistent communications with the implementations team. To make things simpler, I have however refrained
            from referencing them too much. <br><br>

            The implementations team did not get as far in their development as we in the design team during the 2-ish week (translated to full time). First, there was
            some restarting time for them as they had to re-allocate their resources from setting up an android phone environment to set up and learn the framework for
            WearOS. I am grateful they actually had faith in our idea and decided to commit to it even though it meant more challenges for them. Next, most of the 
            programmers were only generally into programming and had other interests too. I can only salute them in their effort in trying to make this project work! <br><br>

            Nevertheless, I'm sure that with a bit more time on our hands we would have been able to actually
            have something working in itself! We had already started getting up our Face Design as can be seen on the picture, and the navigation menu would have been
            the easy part!
          
        </div>
        <img src="images/MC_Physicalprot_1.jpg" class="renterximg" style="display: inline-block; width: 232px; margin:8px 0 0 24px;">

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <img src="images/Testingvisual.png" class="renterximg" style="display: inline-block; width: 212px; margin:0 48px 120px 0;">

        <div id="evaluationparagraph">
          <ul>
            <li>Evaluted with 4 participants</li>
            <li>Opportunity sampling</li>
            <li>Checked for usability and look & feel</li>
          </ul>

          <p p style="margin-top: 0;">
          The users liked the look and feel of the product, and generally felt that the look and feel of the product was intact.
          The contemporary recording of noise levels was regarded as especially helpful, as both the numbers, its simplicity and the colours help them interpret their situation.
          <br><br>
          However, there were some discussion regarding the decibel lines presented in the long term view, where some users first believed they had spatial qualities, showing which directions
          has the lowest and highest noise levels. In hindsight, this misunderstanding could have been due to how the test was performed. Nevertheless, this only showcase how broad of a perspective
          one as a designer has to have when designing smartwatch solutions. Other than that, there were no misunderstandings.
          <br><br>
          In fact, it's not so surprising that the decibel lines as a background of the watch's face may require learning, as it's quite non-verbose. However, it follows a basic pattern which upon learned,
          is easy to follow.
          </p>
        </div>
        


        
        


        <h3>Final Reflections</h3>
        This project has taught me a lot of things, perhaps most notably how different we ended up with a smartwatch app compared to our initial thoughts of making
        a self-reporting mobile app for sound recordings on a map. Of course, early phases in ideation often do end up being quite hectic and volatile, but I feel in
        this case the changes were manifested much more clearly. Perhaps one of the reasons was that I also had a developments team in the picture we had to relay
        our information to. <br><br>

        Again, this project has only further cemented my respect for the design discipline and how much great work good designers put into their work. I will remember
        this project when I work with things that just don't seem to fit the medium it is on. May actually just be that the current solution is on the wrong platform!
